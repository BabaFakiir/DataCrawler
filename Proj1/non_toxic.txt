This is going to be a brief post, because I’m not feeling well today. It’s just a cold, but I’m really tired and not up to doing much. The election is less than a month off. I got my mail-in ballot a couple of days ago, and I plan to send it in today or tomorrow. I can’t wait to vote for Kamala Harris. I would have done it already, but there are a bunch of ballot questions I have to read about first. One that I know I will vote for will end the practice of  requiring students to pass standardized tests (MCAS)  in order to graduate.   Kamala Harris and Howard Stern   Harris has given a bunch of interviews this week, and more are coming. Of course the mainstream media is not happy, because she chose interviewers who are likely to reach voters who don’t follow the news day to day like us politics junkies. Alec Regimbal at SFGate:  Kamala Harris’ viral interview appearances are really pissing off legacy media .\xa0 Politico opened its\xa0 morning newsletter \xa0on Sunday with a gripe.   “DON’T CALL IT A ‘MEDIA BLITZ’ — After avoiding the media for nigh on her whole campaign, VP KAMALA HARRIS is … still largely avoiding the media,” the two authors of Playbook wrote. The specific media the authors are talking about here is “legacy media,” also called the “mainstream media.” Think CNN, the New York Times or Fox News. Politico accuses Harris of skirting outlets like those in favor of alternative venues, such as podcasts and late-night TV. The complaint comes after Harris’ team announced her latest media schedule. On Monday, she’s slated to appear on CBS News’ “60 Minutes,” and then on Thursday, she plans to\xa0stop in Nevada for a Univision town hall. She was interviewed on the wildly popular sex and dating podcast “Call Her Daddy” in an episode that was released on Sunday, and later this week, she’s scheduled to appear on “The View,” “The Howard Stern Show” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”   The Playbook authors admit that the “60 Minutes” interview and the Univision town hall may offer some value to voters, but they take issue with the other appearances on her schedule.   “Let’s be real here: Most of these are not the types of interviews that are going to press her on issues she may not want to talk about, even as voters want more specifics from Harris,” the authors wrote. “Instead, expect most of these sit-downs to be a continuation of the ‘vibes’ campaign Harris has perfected.”   Harris and Stephen Colbert   Politico’s real gripe, though, is that Harris is doing a disservice to voters by avoiding difficult interviews with news outlets like, well, Politico. This is something that only news outlets like Politico care about. Voters don’t care. Anyone reading or watching exclusive news interviews with Harris is already an engaged voter and has probably already decided who they’re going to vote for in November. Harris is employing a smart strategy. When your opponent in an election is Donald Trump, and tens of millions of people will vote for you based on the fact that you’re not Trump, you can afford to spend time courting, and possibly energizing, the folks who are less engaged with politics. “Call her Daddy” is the\xa0 fifth-most popular podcast \xa0on Spotify. Is it really not worth an hour of Harris’ time to appear in front of that audience?   Politico says its criticism is warranted because somebody needs to ask Harris the tough questions that voters want answered. But she’s already doing that.\xa0 CBS News released a preview \xa0of Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview, and it shows her talking about her proposed economic policies. What tough questions is she not answering? Politico never says.   Here’s a tough question: Who cares? To complain that a presidential candidate is not doing interviews with the same outlets that have had almost exclusive access to presidential candidates forever reeks of superciliousness. It’s also counterintuitive. Essentially saying to Harris, “Come do an interview with us so we can kick your ass” is not a persuasive argument. When I was in college studying journalism, my professors often warned that journalists tend to display a uniquely annoying type of arrogance. That’s exactly the type of self-important pretense that we’re seeing here.     Harris is doing exactly what she needs to do, and she’s not going to be intimidated by the likes of Politico, or even The New York Times. She was on 60 Minutes on Monday. Yesterday she went on The View,  The Howard Stern Show , and Stephen Colbert. I haven’t heard/seen the first two, but I did watch Colbert’s show last night. Harris was great and the audience reaction was enthusiastic, to put it mildly. More interviews are coming. I’m sure by now you’ve heard about the new book by Bob Woodward that is coming out next week. As usual, Woodward kept quiet about important information in order to increase sales. The biggest revelation is that Donald Trump sent Covid tests to Vladimir Putin during the time when Americans were desperate for tests and thousands of people were dying every day. In addition, Trump has stayed in contact with Putin since he left the White House. Isaac Stanley-Becker at The Washington Post:  Trump secretly sent covid tests to Putin during 2020 shortage, new book says .\xa0 As the coronavirus tore through the world in 2020, and the United States and other countries confronted a\xa0 shortage of tests \xa0designed to detect the illness, President\xa0 Donald Trump  secretly sent coveted tests to Russian President Vladimir Putin for his personal use.   Putin, petrified of the virus, accepted the supplies but took pains to prevent political fallout — not for him, but for his American counterpart. He cautioned Trump not to reveal that he had dispatched the scarce medical equipment to Moscow, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor\xa0 Bob Woodward . Putin, according to the book, told Trump, “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.” Four years later, the personal relationship between the two men appears to have persisted, Woodward reports, as Trump campaigns to return to the White House and Putin orchestrates his bloody assault on Ukraine. In early 2024, the former president ordered an aide away from his office at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida, so he could conduct a private phone call with the Russian leader, according to Woodward’s account. The book does not describe what the two men purportedly discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact. But the unnamed Trump aide cited in the book indicated that the GOP standard-bearer may have spoken to Putin as many as seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021. The book does not describe what the two men purportedly discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact. But the unnamed Trump aide cited in the book indicated that the GOP standard-bearer may have spoken to Putin as many as seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021.   These interactions between Trump and the authoritarian leader of a country at war with an American ally form the basis of Woodward’s conclusion that Trump is worse than Richard M. Nixon, whose presidency was undone by the Watergate scandal\xa0 exposed a half-century ago by Woodward and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein . “Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history and is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential candidate in 2024,” Woodward writes in the book, “ War ,” which is set to be released Oct. 15.     Trump denied sending the tests to Putin but, unfortunately for him, the Kremlin has confirmed the report. Politico:  Kremlin confirms Trump secretly sent Covid tests to Putin at peak of pandemic . The Kremlin confirmed on Wednesday that former United States President Donald Trump sent Russian President Vladimir Putin Covid-19 testing kits during the height of the pandemic, as reported by American journalist Bob Woodward in a new book. “We also sent equipment at the beginning of the pandemic,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a written response on Wednesday,\xa0 Bloomberg reported . That the U.S. and Russia\xa0 exchanged medical equipment \xa0during the pandemic was already known. But Woodward\xa0 writes in his book \xa0that when Trump was still president in 2020, he “secretly sent Putin a bunch of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines for his personal use” during a time period when Covid tests were scarce. I’m not sure why “journalists” aren’t asking about the top secret documents that Trump was storing at Mar-a-Lago when he spoke to Putin. Remember, not all of the documents have been returned. Marcy Wheeler at Emptywheel:  As Russia Overtly Helps Trump Get Elected, Trump Continues to Check in with Vladimir Putin. \xa0   According to CNN , Bob Woodward’s latest book reveals that Trump has spoken to Vladimir Putin as many as seven times since leaving the Presidency. “In one scene, Woodward recounts a moment at Mar-a-Lago where Trump tells a senior aide to leave the room so “he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.” “According to Trump’s aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, maybe as many as seven in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021,” Woodward writes. Woodward asked Trump aide Jason Miller whether Trump and Putin had spoken since he left the White House. “Um, ah, not that, ah, not that I’m aware of,” Miller told Woodward. “I have not heard that they’re talking, so I’d push back on that,” Miller added. Woodward writes that Biden’s Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines “carefully hedged” when asked about whether there were any post-presidency Trump-Putin calls. “I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin. I wouldn’t purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done,” Haines said, according to Woodward.” According to WaPo’s\xa0 version of the Woodward story \xa0the incident where Trump asked an aide to leave the room happened in early 2024. This is unsurprising. After all, Trump has repeatedly described speaking to Putin in advance of the Ukraine invasion, including fairly explicitly during\xa0 the debate with Joe Biden . “When Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we’re going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never.” But the confirmation that Trump keeps speaking to Putin is important for several other reasons. We still don’t know where all the stolen documents are If Trump was speaking to Putin before the Ukraine investigation and at least as recently as earlier this year, he was speaking to him\xa0 during \xa0the investigation into his stolen documents,\xa0 during \xa0the period when Trump was hiding boxes from his attorney to make sure he could steal documents. Trump was going back and referring to some of these documents during the period he worked with Putin. And perhaps most importantly, there were presumably classified documents loaded onto his plane on June 3, 2022 that got flown back to Bedminster, and probably some\xa0 remained hidden at Mar-a-Lago \xa0(the FBI failed to search a room off Trump’s suite). The FBI has never found the missing classified documents. Trump was charged with hoarding some of America’s most secret documents in his basement. And during that entire period, he was checking in regularly with the leader of a hostile foreign country, the one who keeps helping him get elected. There’s more at the Emptywheel link. Another strange Trump lie: he claimed to have spent time in Gaza. Daniel Dale at CNN:  Fact check: No evidence for Trump’s claim he has been to Gaza .\xa0   After\xa0 Donald Trump \xa0was asked in a Monday interview about the future prospects of Gaza, the former president\xa0 made a curious claim : “You know, I’ve been there, and it’s rough.” There is no public evidence of Trump ever having been to Gaza, which has been governed by militant group Hamas since 2007. He certainly\xa0 didn’t go to Gaza as president , and CNN,\xa0 The New York Times \xa0and\xa0 The Washington Post \xa0have all found no proof he made a prior visit. Perhaps he merely meant he has been to Palestinian territory, since he did\xa0 visit the West Bank in 2017 ? Or maybe he was just talking about having been to the broader region? Nope. Trump’s campaign said Monday night that he meant what he said about having been to Gaza in particular – and the campaign insisted the claim is true. “President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN. Leavitt, though, did not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed trip to Gaza. And she did not respond when we repeatedly asked for even the most basic information, like the year of the supposed visit. So we were highly skeptical – because Trump has a\xa0 long history of making things up , because of the lack of public evidence, because the Times of Israel has\xa0 reported \xa0that Trump had\xa0 never even visited Israel \xa0before his presidency, and because the Trump campaign had offered a substantively different comment to The New York Times earlier Monday. That\xa0 earlier comment , which a campaign official provided only on condition of anonymity, did not say Trump had actually been to Gaza. Instead, the anonymous campaign official tried some spin, correctly saying that Trump has been to Israel but wrongly saying, “Gaza is in Israel.” We asked three former Trump officials who worked on Middle East policy whether they know of any proof for the former president’s claim, and the campaign’s claim to CNN, that Trump has been to Gaza itself. The only one who has responded, Trump-appointed former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs\xa0 David Schenker , said in an email: “As far as I know, he’s never traveled there. He did not go in 2017 when he visited Israel. I think this story is probably already over.” Pretty much everything that comes out of Trump’s mouth is a lie. I’m going to end with a serious piece by Tom Nichols at the Atlantic:  The Moment of Truth.  The subhead is “The reelection of Donald Trump would mark the end of George Washington’s vision for the presidency—and the United States.” Last November , during a symposium at Mount Vernon on democracy, John Kelly, the retired Marine Corps general who served as Donald Trump’s second chief of staff, spoke about George Washington’s historic accomplishments—his leadership and victory in the Revolutionary War, his vision of what an American president should be. And then Kelly offered a simple, three-word summary of Washington’s most important contribution to the nation he liberated. “He went home,” Kelly said. The message was unambiguous. After leaving the White House, Kelly had described Trump as a “ person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about .” At Mount Vernon, he was making a clear point: People who are mad for power are a mortal threat to democracy. They may hold different titles—even\xa0 President —but at heart they are tyrants, and all tyrants share the same trait: They never voluntarily cede power The American revolutionaries feared a powerful executive; they had, after all, just survived a war with a king. Yet when the Founders gathered in 1787 to draft the Constitution, they approved a powerful presidential office, because of their faith in one man: Washington.   Washington’s life is a story of heroic actions, but also of temptations avoided, of things he would not do. As a military officer, Washington refused to take part in a plot to overthrow Congress. As a victorious general, he refused to remain in command after the war had ended. As president, he refused to hold on to an office that he did not believe belonged to him. His insistence on the rule of law and his willingness to return power to its rightful owners—the people of the United States—are among his most enduring gifts to the nation and to democratic civilization. Forty-four men have succeeded Washington so far. Some became titans; others finished their terms without distinction; a few ended their service to the nation in ignominy. But each of them knew that the day would come when it would be their duty and honor to return the presidency to the people.   All but one, that is. Donald Trump and his authoritarian political movement represent an existential threat to every ideal that Washington cherished and encouraged in his new nation. They are the incarnation of Washington’s misgivings about populism, partisanship, and the “spirit of revenge” that\xa0 Washington lamented as the animating force of party politics . Washington feared that, amid constant political warfare, some citizens would come to “seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual,” and that eventually a demagogue would exploit that sentiment. Today, America stands at such a moment. A vengeful and emotionally unstable former president—a convicted felon, an insurrectionist, an admirer of foreign dictators, a racist and a misogynist—desires to return to office as an autocrat. Trump has left no doubt about his intentions; he practically shouts them every chance he gets. His deepest motives are to salve his ego, punish his enemies, and place himself above the law. Should he regain the Oval Office, he may well bring with him the experience and the means to complete the authoritarian project that he began in his first term.       Read the rest at The Atlantic.

So-called "e-Pollbook Judge" work involves looking up voters in a registration system, registering them if they aren\'t currently registered, and printing and delivering various types of ballots to the voters. The half-day "Tech Judge" training involved learning how to help voters who want to use the touchscreen "Ballot Marking Devices" (aka BMDs) including how to inspect the tamper-evident seals that are used to secure the various data connection points (eg, USB ports) that are vulnerable to tampering if a threat actor cared to mess with how it works. The BMDs include assistive technologies, which help people with a range of physical or visual disabilities fill out their ballot. Most of what we\'ll be doing will involve helping voters who are not long term residents, who may not even be registered to vote in Colorado (the vote center will be located at the UMC at the University of Colorado in Boulder). One of the services least well used is something called "Mail Ballot To Go" ( # MBTG ) which was more widely used in 2020, when the pandemic was in full swing and no vaccines were widely available to address COVID. Voters who use MBTG call a phone line and arrange to have a ballot brought out to them at their car at a time they schedule, not unlike grocery pickup. The clerk & recorder still allows voters to use MBTG though we would prefer it if you would just come inside to vote in person if you must come to the polling place.

It\'s going to be a busy one, even though most voters in Colorado will get their ballots in the mail sometime in the next week. I hope to see you at the polls!

The Cultural Divide, the culture around FediForum is  #NGO  and  #liberal ,  #dotcons -friendly, a path that tends to centralize control and enclosure, even in discussions about decentralization. The use of  #closedsource  tools like Zoom and Eventbrite highlights this contradiction. This cultural divide is significant, grassroots communities, including those on SocialHub, reject participation in spaces dominated by tools and processes that contradict the  #4opens  values. While this isn’t necessarily about whether the individuals involved are “good or bad,” it’s crucial to acknowledge the cultural influence of  #NGO  and corporate models, that seek to enclose and professionalize what should remain a grassroots, commons-based path, we need to do this so as not to simply end up enclosing the commons in ignorant “common sense” paths. Now that’s a mouth twister 😉 Lack of a Bridge, suggests a commons-oriented solution—a bridge between these two cultural approaches through transparent linking and collaboration between different projects (e.g., FediForum and SocialHub) which would respect the decentralized nature of the  #openweb . I personally talk to them about this at the first event, unfortunately, this advice was ignored, and the  #NGO  path continued, leading to the ideological exclusion of grassroots participants who have been building the Fediverse and the openweb for years at this paywalled event The  #4opens  is useful to highlight what for meany people is an invisible, thus unimportant divide: Applying the  #4opens  framework is a helpful way to assess the project’s alignment with the openweb’s foundational values. Here’s a  quick DRAFT  breakdown of how FediForum fares: Open Data: They are somewhat open, using Creative Commons licenses and publishing event videos openly, but the paywall during the events limits input and participation, reducing the openness. Partial TICK.Open Source: The CMS might be FOSS, but the reliance on closed-source platforms for the events themselves (Zoom, Eventbrite) contradicts the open-source ethos. Half TICK or none.Open Industrial Standards: Limited to some RSS feeds, but the integration of proprietary platforms makes it hard to give full credit here. No TICK.Open Process: Organizing is closed, with paywalled events, though the unconference format allows for more open discussions. However, the ideological closure to many grassroots participants remains. Half TICK. At best, this makes FediForum a bronze  #4opens  project with significant room for improvement. At worst, it’s not aligned with the  #4opens , thus the  #openweb  at all. Moving Forward, what’s missing is a mediation space where these different paths can intersect without one side dominating the other. This space could look like the  #OGB  with each participant being an affiliate stakeholder  https://unite.openworlds.info/Open-Media-Network/openwebgovernancebody The path that keeps “commons” open is activism, which is about making it hard for these values to be ignored. In this case, we could start this by pushing for the adoption of simple steps like linking and transparency ( #KISS ). This can begin to rebuild bridges that better reflects the diverse contributions of all involved, without closing doors on those who helped build it in the first place. https://hamishcampbell.com/the-mainstreaming-is-always-filled-with-imperialism-we-need-to-constantly-be-mediating-this-mess-making/ #4opens   #closedsource   #dotcons   #KISS   #liberal   #mainstreaming   #NGO   #OGB   #openweb', 113206933607545743: "The Metz family is a family in  # Luxembourg  that was prominent in politics and industry in the mid- and late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.
