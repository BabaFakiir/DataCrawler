Ask yourself, if that\'s your issue, who are you going to  # vote  for? ...[O]n Monday, Trump said something about the Middle East that is significant.  He said that Gaza could be rebuilt "better than Monaco," the Mediterranean tax-haven for the ultra wealthy. Trump said of Gaza: "It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything."  That\'s the real estate developer in him speaking. The idea of turning Gaza into Monaco, or at least into Miami Beach East, is not new with the Trump family.  Jared Kushner made the same point earlier this year, adding a small detail. Kushner said that the coastline was "very valuable waterfront property."  He envisioned filling it with luxury condos and five-star hotels. The only problem with Trump\'s plan and young Jared\'s plan is that Gaza is not empty. Over two million Gazans live in the Gaza Strip. How would they fit into these plans?  Trump doesn\'t say, but the implication is that they should be gotten rid of somehow. Kushner is more explicit. He wants Israel to bulldoze an area in the Negev Desert and transport the Gazans there so he can make lots of money developing Gaza into Miami Beach East or now maybe Monaco. # boostingIsSharing   # election   # kamalaharris   # kamala   # vote  a  # democrat  ticket https://www. electoral-vote.com/evp2024/Ite ms/Oct10-3.html', 113283774549138064: '# Florida   # Democrat   # JaredMoskowitz   # ShutsDown   # MarjorieTaylorGreene  And Her  # Hurricane   # Conspiracy  ‚Äò # Machine ‚Äô  Moskowitz slammed the  # Georgia   # Republican  for her ‚Äúvery dangerous‚Äù  # disinformation  and unhinged  # ConspiracyTheories   https://www. huffpost.com/entry/jared-mosko witz-marjorie-taylor-greene-hurricane-conspiracy_n_6706df96e4b0c34b3eb98ea9', 113283660128562912: '# VicePresident   # KamalaHarris  May Finally Be Breaking Through to the Most  # Critical   # Voters .
